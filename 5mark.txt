3.The first and the last terms of an AP are 10 and 361respectively. If its common difference is 9 then find the number of terms and their total sum?
4.A motor boat whose speed is 24km/hr in still water takes 1hr more to go 32km upstream than to return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of the stream.
5.A train was to cover a distance of 2800km in a prefixed time duration. But due to the foggy weather the speed of train was slowed down which reduced the average speed of the train for the overall journey by 100 km/hr.  The time duration for the journey also increased by 30min. Determine the original speed and travel time taken by the train.

7.If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in distinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio. Prove it.
8.Find the area of the minor segment of a circle of radius 14 cm, when its central angle is 60°.Also find the area of the corresponding major segment. [Use π = 22/7]
9.Prove that the chords of a circle that are equidistant from the centre are equal in length.
10.The angle of elevation of the top of a cliff when observed from the top of a lighthouse is 60o and the angle of depression of the base of the cliff observed from the same point comes to be 30o. If the height of the lighthouse above water level is 12 m then calculate the height of the cliff and its distance from the lighthouse. [Use, (3)^1/2= 1.732]
